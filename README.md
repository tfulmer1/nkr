# nkr
Nested Key Retrieval (nkr - 'nuker') is a Python library for finding values associated with keys buried in a nested structure

# How it works
nkr uses duck typing and recursive functions to move through an entire nested structure (any combinations of dicts and lists) so long as the first level target is a dict. It has a function for retrieving the first/only value associated with a key or a generator function to return a list of ALL values associated with a key
